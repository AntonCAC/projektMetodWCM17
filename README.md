# projektMetodWCM17
a test to use git for collecting assets for a course in project management. 
The materials here are mainly for test. 
So if you are looking for learning and knowledge look elsewhere. As time goes; eventually a course will take shape
So let us write something about us: 
- who we are
- why we believe in this
- could my students create a project with this?
